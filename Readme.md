## Notes from the developer

### How to run the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in PHPStorm
3. Run the following commands in the terminal:
    2. `npm install`
    3. `npm start:dev` (for nodemon) or `npm start` (for production)

The project is currently running on Heroku, not cyclic, because it doesn't use socket io. :(
